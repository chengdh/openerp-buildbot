=== Software development ===


The structure of the software development schema is divided into 
logical groups of operations:
    - Packages: the pieces that make a software project up
    - Code: the repositories, series, branches and commits of the code
    - Buildbot: the machines that can test the software, and their state
    - Tests: the results of software building and testing.


Package
---------

A software package is a product that we want to build. It is comprised
of components.
