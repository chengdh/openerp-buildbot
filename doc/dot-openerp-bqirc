ftp_port=8923
mach_log = openerp-test.log
; Have a machine-format log to a "openerp-test.log" file in the
; directory we run the bqi from.
txt_log = stdout
; Also display all logs, bare, to the console. Strongly advised.
; You could use "stderr", too.
; xml_log = foobar.log.xml
; Yes there is an option of xml logging, but only useful if you
; ever build a parser for them. "mach_log" is a good alternative.
